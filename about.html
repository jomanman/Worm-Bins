                <h3>Environmental Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Energy conservation is one of the most important things you can do to reduce your carbon footprint. Leaving your electricals on standby needlessly uses up energy – hit the off switch and you could see huge improvements, most noticeably in your energy bills!></li>
                    <li>Waste not, want not. Did you know that 7.3 million tonnes of food is wasted in the UK every year? This isn’t just a huge waste of food and money, it adds to the amount of CO2 being created in landfills.</li>
                    <li>Chances are that if you’re thinking about taking on a more eco-friendly lifestyle then you’ll already be recycling. But could you improve your recycling-ability (now a word)? You can recycle almost everything, from batteries to paper to cars. Before you throw it away, take a minute to find out if you could recycle it instead.</li>
                    <li>Take short showers:  Hot showers are an incredible luxury, so don’t waste this by spending far too long in the shower</li>
                </ul>
