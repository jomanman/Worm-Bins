        <p>The OGHS enviroschools group is passionate about keeping our school healthy and sustainable.
            This means that it would be unimaginably awesome if we could minimise our waste. 
            The worm farms allow us to do just that. By throwing your waste in here instead of the average bins,
            we can keep our worms healthy and school clean. But be careful what you throw in there as there are some things that 
            aren't very worm-friendly. Use the checklist page and the one above to find out if your waste can benefit our worms.
